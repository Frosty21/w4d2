# W4D2 Description
### ORM Objective
Today we will extend our work with relational databases by connecting to a PostgreSQL database from Node.

We will also cover the important topic of turning relational data to usable objects in our application using a query building library called Knex.

Since you'll begin working on your mid-term projects tomorrow, you will find out who your team members are.

Lastly there is also an important Git exercise that you will be pairing with your project partner at the end of the day. It will introduce you to use Git in a collaborative manner, including how to deal with merge conflicts.
